# Project-Marathon
## A mITX, no-compromise, small form factor computer case

The goal was to create a mITX case with practically no compromise on PSU, GPU and CPU cooler sizes which can also fit 2 full-sized HDD's.
The result is simple, fully modular case, with small footprint compared to commercial, big-quanity builds with similar specs (17 vs 20~21 litres).

## Specification
|||

| Case dimensions|   W:186 x D:343 x H:269 mm (17 litres) |
|Material|   Powder coated, laser engraved stainless steel |
|Motherboard|mITX
|Max CPU cooler height|Up to 160mm (optional AIO 240mm bracket)
|Max GPU dimensions|Up to 2,5 slot non reference (W:140 x D:325 x H:50 mm)
|Power supply|SFX, SFX-L, ATX, ATX-L. Max length is GPU-lenght and PSU-modularity dependent (~200mm max for short cards ~160mm for long cards )
|Storage|2x 3.5" HDD AND/OR 4x 2,5" SSD/HDD
|I/O|Power LED, anti-vandal switch
