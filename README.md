# Project-Marathon
## A mITX, no-compromise, small form factor computer case

The goal was to create a mITX case with practically no compromise on PSU, GPU and CPU cooler sizes which can also fit 2 full-sized HDD's.
The result is simple, fully modular case, with small footprint compared to commercial, big-quanity builds with similar specs (17 vs 20~21 litres).

## Extras
Case was 100% designed and created by Robert Taube in Autodesk Inventor 2018 using sheet metal editor and sticking to all computer-related standarizations. If you want more info on this design, real-life images, .step/.ipt files ect., feel free to contact me :)
